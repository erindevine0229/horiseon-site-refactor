# Horiseon Site Refactoring


## Description
A marketing company requested code refactoring in order to make their site more accessible and organize/consolidate code. Changes needed to make made while maintaining the visual style integrity of the client-facing site and maintaining functionality of all links. The codebase was improved upon by assigning semantic HTML elements, organizing and reducing redundancy in the CSS code and adding appropriate website title as well as alt attributes to all images. As can be seen by the included images, the visual integrity of the site has remained unchanged.
